# Instructions 
This document is for week three research. When week three activities open up later this month, begin to update this file to demonstrate your own ongoing research, experimentation, and exploration of related topic matter. In the meantime, here are some resources if you would like to get started early...    


**Topic 1:** Redux Essentials, Part 1: Redux [Overview & Concepts](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts)  
Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the recommended way of working with Redux today. Before getting started with RTK, it's a good idea to become familiar with Redux in general. You can begin by reviewing Redux Essentials, Part 1. This will help you understand the fundamentals of Redux, before diving into Redux Toolkit. 



**Topic 2:** Redux Toolkit     
Redux has evolved over time along with the [ecosystem](https://redux.js.org/introduction/ecosystem/) of tools that help us spin things up. [Redux Toolkit](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started) is another way of implementing data integration. In addition to assigned research, spend some time looking at Redux Toolkit to understand ways it can simplify setup and use of Redux. 

Work through the [Quick Start Tutorial](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/quick-start) for dev credit and add this work to your dev folder. Update this document to capture your own independent study on state management this week. 

**Topic 3:** State Management  
Outside of the two topics listed above, you can also include in this research, notes on week three resources.
