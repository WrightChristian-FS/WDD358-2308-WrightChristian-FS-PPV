## How to Build a Production Ready API 
This article covers the importance of creating a good user experience for APIâ€™s in relationship to the developers who consume them. It highlights how overlooking API UX can create technical debt with product development and execution as the API gets used by various developers for different needs. The article also provides best practices and guidelines for designing a developer-friendly, production-ready RESTful API, including tips on resource design, HTTP verbs and URLs, content types, error handling, pagination, and sorting.

## Divide or Join: The Frontend Backend Dilemma 
This article explores the debate of whether frontend and backend in web development should be kept together or separated. Frontend refers to the user-visible section, while backend supports data management and interactions. Keeping them together allows for similar concepts and syntax, minimized miscommunications, efficient resource usage with full-stack developers, and effective teamwork. However, it can be inefficient for large projects and limits customization. Separating frontend and backend allows for wider technology specialists, modularity, quick development, and API consolidation. However, it increases communication and code management overhead and requires synchronous commits. The choice depends on project needs and considerations of advantages and disadvantages.

## Learn SQL: Types of relations 
The article discusses three types of relations in databases: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. It emphasizes the importance of understanding these relations in the context of designing a database model and analyzing data. The one-to-many relation is the most used and serves as the basis for the other two types. It is demonstrated through examples of storing customer data and call records between employees and customers. The many-to-many relation requires the addition of an intermediary table to connect two tables with multiple rows on each side. The one-to-one relation is rarely used and typically involves storing specific details separately for an entity in a separate table.
