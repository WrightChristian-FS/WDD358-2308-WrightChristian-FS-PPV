## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1
🌵 Challenges - This week the biggest challenge that I am having is understanding the Github workflow. 
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I was able to successfully create a project proposal. I was able to also create a db diagram based off the project proposal. 
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - I will continue to work on understanding the github workflow.
