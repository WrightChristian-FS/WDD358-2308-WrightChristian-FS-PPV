## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>

### Week 1
🌵 Challenges - In Week 1, I encountered three significant hurdles. Firstly, I grappled with time management. Secondly, I had to redefine my understanding of APIs. Previously, I believed APIs were exclusively for linking the front-end and back-end of an application, but I also discovered they serve to connect different applications. Lastly, I struggled to pinpoint the correct repository to work on. 

<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - I successfully crafted a project proposal and followed it up by creating a database diagram aligned with the proposal.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - I will continue to work on understanding the github workflow. 


### Week 2

🌵 Challenges - Throughout Week 2, my challenges persisted, particularly in the realm of time management. Additionally, I grappled with comprehending the appropriate and anticipated GitHub workflow.

🏆 Accomplishments - In Week 2, I successfully wrapped up my research and finished my routing assignment.
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - I will continue to work on understanding the github workflow.
