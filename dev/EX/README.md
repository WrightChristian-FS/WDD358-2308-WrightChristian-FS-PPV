# Example 

**Building a Portfolio**   
For development credit begin to organize past projects, code snippets, research, and other content in development that you may like to use for your own Portfolio. Treat this activity as a way to prepare content that you may wish to show others in the future. A portfolio site or resume for instance can link to this work in progress, to highlight your study and ongoing work. 

Organize portfolio work into folders like this one and be sure to include README files that explain the work in progress. Review [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) to generate ideas for your README files. 

**For example...**  
Give this folder a title, related to a concept or project you worked on or are currently studying. Then add related past project work, code snippets, and ideas in progress to this folder. For development credit, begin to refactor or enhance this work. 

This can include...

* Adding inline code comments
* Adding, fixing, or continuing to work on features
* Organizing work into sub folders


Instead of adding content to this repository, you are also allowed to link to other repository work in progress, as long as it meets these requirements...

* It relates to your portfolio
* It is accessible to your instructor
* It includes a README and shows ongoing refactoring

**Note**  
When adding past work to this repository, remember to remove any .git folder after copying the work. This ensures you aren't copying a repository into another repository, which can cause issues with version control.   


* **The .git Folder**: When adding other project work to this repository, make sure you aren't including an additional ".git" folder in the copied material. This is an invisible folder you will find in any repository. It's what git uses to keep track of repository changes. You can look for this .git folder by turning on invisibility. 
* **Turn Visibility On or Off on a Mac**: To quickly turn on or off invisible files on a Mac, press: **shift**, **command**, and the **period key** on your keyboard.
