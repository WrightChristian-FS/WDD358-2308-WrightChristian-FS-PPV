# ASL 

If you went through the ASL course, locate and add your project work to this folder. For additional development credit, begin to refactor or enhance this work. This can include...

* Adding inline code comments
* Adding, fixing, or continuing to work on existing features
* Updating this README to explain the work in progress

<br>

**Note:**  
When adding past work to this repository, remember to remove any .git folder after copying the work. This ensures you aren't copying a repository into another repository, which can cause issues with version control.   


* **The .git Folder**: When adding other project work to this repository, make sure you aren't including an additional ".git" folder in the copied material. This is an invisible folder you will find in any repository. It's what git uses to keep track of repository changes. You can look for this .git folder by turning on invisibility. 
* **Turn Visibility On or Off on a Mac**: To quickly turn on or off invisible files on a Mac, press: **shift**, **command**, and the **period key** on your keyboard. 

As you continue with development, be sure to update this README to explain the work in progress. Review [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) to generate ideas for this README file.
