# ShipIt App ...ðŸš€

This project is the front end version of the ShipIt app. This code is updated and revised on occasion. Use this material as additional reference while conducting your own research, development, and personal challenge activity.

**Note:**   
ESLint with the [Airbnb Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) is installed and configured in the api folder, and again in the reactjs folder.  Each server is basically using its own configuration for ESLint. One is optimized for React, and the other is slimmed down for just node. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In this project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youb're on your own.

You donb't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnb't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnb't be useful if you couldnb't customize it when you are ready for it.
